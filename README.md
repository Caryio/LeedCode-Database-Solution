# LeedCode Database Questions' Solutions
All Database questions' solutions in LeedCode (except for those who need subscription)

`Last Update on Sep 11 2023`

## Abstract
When I got the *30 Days of Pandas* badge and *Top SQL 50* badge, I found my motivation and love to Database going deep further. So I push forward by finishing all database questions in LeetCode. Some of them are in `Python` and some of them are in `SQL`. Those premiunm quentions are not include.

## How do I find these questions and practice?
Go to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and click the Database button. Or just use this [link](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/).

## Contribute to this repo
I don't know if LeetCode will add new Database questions to their problem set or not.

If you find that I've missed any questions or new questions are added, feel free to contact me.
