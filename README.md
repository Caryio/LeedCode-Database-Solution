## Abstract
When I got the *30 Days of Pandas* badge and *Top SQL 50* badge, I found my motivation and love to Database going deep further. So I push forward by finishing all database questions in LeetCode. Some of them are in `Python` and some of them are in `SQL`. 
> Those premiunm quentions are not include.

## How do I find these questions and practice?
Go to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and click the Database button. Or just use this [link](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/).
