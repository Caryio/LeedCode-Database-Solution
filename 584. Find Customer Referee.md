# 584. Find Customer Referee
[Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-customer-referee/)
## Intuition
In SQL, we should use
```sql
WHERE
    referee_id != 2 OR referee_id is Null
```
instead of
```sql
WHERE
    referee_id != 2 OR referee_id == Null
```
If we use the latter one, we'll get the ERROR says:
```
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '== `null`' at line 7
```

## Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    name
FROM
    Customer
WHERE
    referee_id != 2 OR referee_id is Null
```
