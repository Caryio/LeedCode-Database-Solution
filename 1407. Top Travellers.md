# 1407. Top Travellers
[Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-travellers/)
## Tip
- Use `group by u.id` instead of `group by u.name` because some people may have same name.
## Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select u.name, if(sum(r.distance),sum(r.distance),0) travelled_distance from Users u left join Rides r on u.id=r.user_id group by u.id order by travelled_distance desc, name
```
