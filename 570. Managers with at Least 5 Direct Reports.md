# 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports
[Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/managers-with-at-least-5-direct-reports/)
## Intuition
- This question is defferent from the former ones because the former ones need to keep `null` using `how=left` or `how=outer`. While this question need `how=inner` to drop all the null.
If you use `outer` in this question, the output will have a `null` which you don't want to see.
- Using `count()` would keep all the columns and therefore take more memory than `size()`.
`size()` will reduce unnecessary columns.

## Python Code
```python
import pandas as pd

def find_managers(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    a=employee.groupby(['managerId']).agg(
        cnt=('managerId','size')
    ).reset_index()
    b=a.merge(employee,how='inner',left_on='managerId',right_on='id')
    return b[b['cnt']>=5].loc[:,['name']]
```
## SQL Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select name from (select a.name, count(a.name) countresult from Employee a join Employee b
on a.id=b.managerid group by a.name, a.id) as result
where result.countresult > 4
```
