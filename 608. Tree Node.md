# 608. Tree Node
[Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-node/description/)
## Why Can't Use 'not in' While 'in' Is Accepted
When there is a `null` in a column, we can't use `not in` in a clause. We can only use `in`.

## Wrong Code - Use `not in`
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select id,
case
when p_id is null then 'Root'
when id not in (
  select p_id from Tree
) then 'Leaf'
else 'Inner'
end type
from Tree
```
All results supposed to be `Leaf` are `Inner` now.
## Right Code - Use `in`
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select id,
case
when p_id is null then 'Root'
when id in (
  select p_id from Tree
) then 'Inner'
else 'Leaf'
end type
from Tree
```
