# 1789. Primary Department for Each Employee
[Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/primary-department-for-each-employee/)
## Solution v1
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select employee_id, department_id from Employee group by employee_id having count(department_id)=1
union
select employee_id, department_id from Employee
where primary_flag='Y'
```
## Solution v2: `count() over(partition by)`
```sql
select t.employee_id, t.department_id from
(select employee_id, department_id, primary_flag, count(department_id) over(partition by employee_id) as cnt from Employee) as t
where t.cnt = 1 or t.primary_flag = 'Y'
```
- `count()` is what you want to do
- `over(partition by)` is where to do, the range or the field of `count()`
- the overall meaning is: perform `count(department_id)` function to every `employee_id`
- comparing to `group by`: it keeps every line. `group by` will combine every line
