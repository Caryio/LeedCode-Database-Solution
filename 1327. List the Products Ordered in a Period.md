# 1327. List the Products Ordered in a Period

[Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/list-the-products-ordered-in-a-period/)
## Knowledge
`having` should be placed behind the `group by`, or we will get the error like this:
```
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'group by p.product_name' at line 6
```
## Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select p.product_name, sum(o.unit) unit from Orders o left join Products p
on o.product_id=p.product_id
where order_date between '2020-02-01' and '2020-02-29'
group by p.product_name having unit >= 100
```
