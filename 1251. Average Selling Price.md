[Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-selling-price/)


New knowledge about `between`.


## BETWEEN
If you don't know exactly what the code does, you can see this:
```sql
select p.product_id, p.start_date, p.end_date, p.price, u.purchase_date, u.units
from Prices p inner join UnitsSold u
on p.product_id=u.product_id and u.purchase_date between p.start_date and p.end_date
```
The result of this code is:
```
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price | purchase_date | units |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----- | ------------- | ----- |
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5     | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20    | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15    | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30    | 2019-03-22    | 30    |
```

## Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select p.product_id, round(sum(p.price*u.units)/sum(units), 2) as average_price
from Prices p join UnitsSold u
on p.product_id=u.product_id and u.purchase_date between p.start_date and p.end_date
group by product_id
```
