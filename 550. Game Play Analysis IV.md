# 550. Game Play Analysis IV
[Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-iv/)
## Intuition
If you don't know why `where` part should contain `player_id`:
because it needs to `group by player_id`, or it will show just one first login date.


## Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select round(count(distinct player_id)/(select count(distinct player_id) from Activity), 2) fraction from Activity a
where (player_id, date_sub(event_date, interval 1 day)) in (select player_id, min(event_date) first_login from Activity group by player_id)
```
