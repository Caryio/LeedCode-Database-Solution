# 585. Investments in 2016
[Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/investments-in-2016/)

## Intuition
The result of the below code:
```sql
select a.pid, b.pid from Insurance a inner join Insurance b on (a.lat,a.lon) = (b.lat,b.lon)
where a.pid<>b.pid
```
is:
```
| pid | pid |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | 1   |
| 3   | 2   |
| 2   | 2   |
| 3   | 3   |
| 2   | 3   |
| 4   | 4   |
```
So when filtering the `where a.pid<>b.pid`, we get the policyholder who has the unique location.
## Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select round(sum(tiv_2016), 2) tiv_2016 from Insurance
where pid not in (
  select a.pid from Insurance a inner join Insurance b on (a.lat,a.lon) = (b.lat,b.lon)
  where a.pid<>b.pid
)
and
tiv_2015 in (
  select tiv_2015 from Insurance group by tiv_2015 having count(pid)>1
)
```
