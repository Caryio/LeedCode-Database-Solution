# 607. Sales Person

[Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sales-person/)
## Intuition
Didn't use any complex ways or algorithm ;-)
## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. `merge` the `sales_person` and `orders`, using `how='outer'`to match the salesman and the order they made. The result table is `a`.
2. `merge` the `a` and `company`, using `how='left'`to match the salesman, order and company. The result table is `b`.
3. We only need salesman's name(which is `b`'s `name_x`) and company's name(which is `b`'s `name_y`). Filter these two and the result is `c`.
4. `name_red` is salemans who negotiated any order with `RED`. Filter them.
5. `merge` `c` and `name_red` and get `d`. Now, in `name_y_y` column of `d`, every salesman who have ever made a order with `RED`, has a `RED` in his/her row.
6. Filter those who doesn't have `RED` and create a new DataFrame. Don't forget `drop_duplicates()` when outputing. 

## Code
```python
import pandas as pd

def sales_person(sales_person: pd.DataFrame, company: pd.DataFrame, orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    a=pd.merge(
        sales_person,orders,how='outer',on='sales_id'
    )
    b=pd.merge(
        a,company,how='left',on='com_id'
    )
    c=b.loc[:,['name_x','name_y']]
    name_red=c[c['name_y'] == 'RED']
    d=pd.merge(
        c,name_red,how='outer',on='name_x'
    )
    result=pd.DataFrame({'name':d[d['name_y_y'] != 'RED']['name_x']})
    return result.drop_duplicates()
```
