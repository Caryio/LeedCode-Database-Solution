select t.query_name, round(avg(t.quality),2) as quality, round(avg(t.poor_query_percentage),2) as poor_query_percentage from
(
    select query_name, sum(rating/position) as quality, if(rating<3,1,0)*100 as poor_query_percentage from Queries group by query_name, result, position, rating
) as t
where t.query_name is not null
group by query_name
