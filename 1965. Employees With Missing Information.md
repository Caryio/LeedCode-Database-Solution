# 1965. Employees With Missing Information

SQL Knowledge: When `FULL OUTER JOIN` isn't Working, Try `UNION`
## Intuition
- Firstly I tried `FULL OUTER JOIN` but it didn't work and got an ERROR.
- Then I found `union` can replace the `FULL OUTER JOIN`. So I did.
 
## The `union` Part Code
```sql
select e.employee_id, e.name, s.salary from Employees e left join Salaries s on e.employee_id=s.employee_id group by employee_id
union
select s.employee_id, e.name, s.salary from Salaries s left join Employees e on e.employee_id=s.employee_id group by employee_id
```
The result of this code is:
```
| employee_id | name     | salary |
| ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| 2           | Crew     | null   |
| 4           | Haven    | 63539  |
| 5           | Kristian | 76071  |
| 1           | null     | 22517  |
```
It looks just like `FULL OUTER JOIN`. I decide to use `union`.
## Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a.employee_id from (
  select e.employee_id, e.name, s.salary from Employees e left join Salaries s on e.employee_id=s.employee_id group by employee_id
  union
  select s.employee_id, e.name, s.salary from Salaries s left join Employees e on e.employee_id=s.employee_id group by employee_id
) a
where a.salary is null or a.name is null
order by a.employee_id asc
```
